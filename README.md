# Portfolio-Projects

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to the repository of my portfolio. <br/>
How do we get from raw datasets to answers? First, we clean and validate the data, answer questions and visualise the results.The projects involve tasks requiring techniques of data cleaning, data preparation, data wranglig, data visualisation, 
and exploratory data analysis using Python modules like pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. <br/>

With these tools and skills, I worked with real data, extracted insights and presented compelling results.

* Exploratory Data Analysis on Anime Data  
* The GitHub History of Scala Language
* NYC AirBnB Data Analysis on DataCamp
